 Welcome to the Hyperledger Composer package for SublimeText



Source

 You can find the source and the documentation at https://github.com/chevdor/HyperledgerComposerSublimeText



Usage

 To get started, create a .cto, .qry or .acl file. SublimeText will then recognize your file as a Hyperledger Composer file and activate the syntax coloriring as well as the snippets.

 To see the list of available snippets, open the Panel (Shift+Command+P) and type 'hyperledger'. All snippets are triggered by their Composer name so they should come up automagically as you type.
